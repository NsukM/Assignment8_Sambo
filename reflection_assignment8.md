# Reflection - Assignment 8

## Granularity Challenges
One major challenge was deciding how detailed each diagram should be. Too much detail made the diagrams complex, while too little detail made them less useful for implementation. I had to strike a balance by focusing only on the critical transitions or activities.

## Agile Alignment
Aligning the diagrams with Agile user stories helped clarify system behavior. For example, user stories related to booking and cancelling a ride directly informed the Booking object's lifecycle and the activity flow of shuttle reservation.

## Comparison
- **State Diagrams** show how individual system components change state over time (object-centric).
- **Activity Diagrams** model the flow of tasks and decision logic during a business process (workflow-centric).

Both diagrams provided valuable perspectives: states ensured system correctness, while activities ensured usability and responsiveness.
